# Work
Scripts and Programs created for work 
## Oasis_billing.py
Oasis_billing.py was created to help validate the PDF invoices that are generated monthly from our Old Inhouse Billing Program. 
-  Currently only 2/3 of this python file is finished. The last 1/3 has been commented out due to time constraints. The Reservation and the Ancillary Services work. Unfortunatley the ancillary services monthly, weekly, and daily charges need to be completed

## Caiso_lap.py
Was Created to pull in LAP prices from CAISO, transform into a Dataframe, and then output a CSV of only the LMP_PRC values

## pdf_scrap.py
Was Created to go scan through multiple PDF files, looking for cases of Unreserved Use for the past several years.
